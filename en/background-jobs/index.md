# Background Jobs

The system executes background jobs to automate tasks.  
Unlike App Automation, system automated tasks are not customisable.

The list of system background tasks is:  

| Task Name                                   | Frequency  |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| DoCreditControlProcessing                   | Hourly     |
| DoEmailProcessing                           | Minutely   |
| DoEmailInvoiceBatchTruckRechargeTruckVersion | Minutely   |
| DoOrderProcessing                           | Minutely   |
| DoTruckProcessing                           | Minutely   |

# Invoicing Review

## Overview
The **Invoicing Review** process ensures that all customer orders are complete, accurate, and ready for invoicing. Reviewing orders before invoicing helps prevent billing errors, ensures timely payment, and improves customer satisfaction.

This guide explains how to review orders prior to generating invoices.

## When to Perform Order Review
- Normally, previous day's invoices are reviewed and processed.
- Same-day processing can be done for completed orders.

## Accessing Order Review
1. Navigate to **Invoice Review** from the Invoicing menu.
2. Use filters if required (e.g., order status, date range, customer name) to list the orders ready for review.

## Steps to Review an Order
1. **Open the Order**  
   Click the **Details** button to view the full order details.

2. **Verify Order Information**  
   - Customer name and contact details
   - Billing address
   - Shipping address (if applicable)
   - Order date and fulfillment date

3. **Check Line Items**  
   - Products or services listed
   - Quantities ordered vs. fulfilled
   - Unit prices and total amounts
   - Discounts applied

4. **Approve, Update, or Hold the Order**  
   - If the order is accurate: click **Approve**.
   - If corrections are needed: update the order accordingly.
   - If further investigation or action is required: set the invoice to **Hold** by clicking **Hold**.

## Common Issues to Watch For
- Incorrect customer billing details
- Mismatched pricing or discounts
- Missing product deliveries or partial shipments
